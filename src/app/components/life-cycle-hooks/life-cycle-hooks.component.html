    In Angular, a framework for building web applications, there is a concept called "life cycle
    hooks" that allow for performing certain actions at different stages of a component's life
    cycle. Life cycle hooks are methods that can be implemented in Angular components to react to
    specific events during the creation, modification, or removal of a component.
  </p>
  <p>Below is a description of several important life cycle hooks in Angular:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <code>ngOnChanges</code>: This hook is executed whenever the value of one or more input
        properties of a component changes.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <code>ngOnInit</code>: This hook is executed once after the component has been initialized.
        It is commonly used for initializing component properties, fetching initial data, or
        subscribing to observables.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <code>ngDoCheck</code>: This hook is executed during every change detection cycle. It is
        called whenever Angular detects changes to the component or its child components.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <code>ngAfterContentInit</code>: This hook is executed once after Angular initializes the
        content projected into the component.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <code>ngAfterContentChecked</code>: This hook is executed after Angular checks the content
        projected into the component and its child components.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <code>ngAfterViewInit</code>: This hook is executed once after Angular initializes the
        component's view and its child views.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <code>ngAfterViewChecked</code>: This hook is executed after Angular checks the component's
        view and its child views.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <code>ngOnDestroy</code>: This hook is executed just before the component is destroyed and
        removed from the component hierarchy. It is used for performing cleanup tasks, such as
        unsubscribing from observables or releasing resources.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Utilizing the appropriate life cycle hooks can be very useful for managing the life cycle of
    components in Angular and controlling various stages of their operation.
